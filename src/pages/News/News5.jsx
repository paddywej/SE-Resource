                                Founded in 1909, University of Queensland (UQ) is a public research university in Australia and is currently ranked at 43rd in the world (QS). Starting from 2024, KMITL and UQ will be offering the Double-Degree (2+2) Bachelor of Engineering Program in Software Engineering (SE). The program enables qualified students entering the SE program from Academic Year 2024 onwards to earn both KMITL and UQ Software Engineering degrees. In this talk, representatives from UQ and KMITL will introduce this double-degree program and the application process and requirements.
